# Crafting Interpreters - Lox
This repository consists of the source code I wrote following the implementation of *jlox* as in the Part I of *Crafting Interpreters*.

You are free to use this source code anyway you like other than just copy-pasting, and putting your name on top of my and Robert Nystrom's work. Make sure to make the most out of this repository.


## Crafting Interpreters
If you don't know already, **Crafting Interpreters** is an awesome, must read book for those who are interested in programming languages and are looking to create one themselves sometime.

It is cleverly designed with it's modern and elegant CSS, designed to look great on any device be it your large Computer screen or the small display of a smartphone. It consists of three parts, where they first introduce you to concepts of language design, then show you a simple implementation in Java, then make you suffer as you try to insert your mind in the C implementation.

It is **FREE** so why not? Btw, I'm not paid for this advertisement or something. I just really enjoy reading it. Yeah no more advertisement on this repo, I promise.


## Introduction
I am a student and coding hobbyist from India. I am really interested in programming languages since *sometime*, yeah a few years ain't a lot. I tried to follow some tutorials on *YouTube* before, they were decent and gave me some idea, until I reached parsing. It just turned into an ideal *easy drawing tutorial*. Nevertheless, I was too scared to try implement everything myself, until a post saved my life. I saw a video that was trying to follow, none other than, **coughs, no more advertisement, I remember.*


## Trying It Out
If you are intersed in the book or my implementation. This implementation is in Java which you can run obviously using *JVM*. But, before you try to go through it, I would suggest you try it first in the *JS Playground* for this same language implemented in vanilla js. You can try it [here](codingwithsantanu.github.io/jslox). Thank me later.
